  <h1>Marching Cubes Code - Step-by-Step Guide</h1>

  <h2>Step 1: Clone the Repository</h2>
  <p>Start by cloning the GitHub repository containing the code. You can use the git clone command to do this. For example, 
    if the repository URL is https://github.com/example/marching-cubes, you can run the following command in your terminal:</p>
    <pre><code>
    # Example git clone https://github.com/example/marching-cubes
      </code></pre>
      <p>This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.</p>

  <h2>Step 2: Navigate to the Repository</h2>
  <p> Change your current working directory to the cloned repository. For example, if the repository is named "marching-cubes," you can use the following command:</p>
  <pre><code>
    # Example cd marching-cubes
  </code></pre>

  <h2>Step 3: Install Dependencies</h2>
  <p>Check if the code has any dependencies, such as libraries or packages, that need to be installed. Typically, you can find this information in the repository's README file or any other provided documentation.
    Look for a section mentioning installation or prerequisites. Follow the instructions to install the required dependencies. Common methods include using package managers like pip or conda. 
    For example, if the repository requires a Python library named "numpy," you can install it using pip:</p>
  <pre><code>
    # Example pip install numpy
  </code></pre>

  <h2>Step 4: Build or Compile</h2>
  <p>Some code repositories may require building or compiling before running. Look for instructions in the repository's documentation or README file on how to 
    build the code. It might involve running specific commands or scripts. Typically, you'll find build instructions for languages like C++, Python, Java, or Rust. 
    Follow the provided instructions carefully to build the code successfully.</p>

  <h2>Step 5: Run the Code</h2>
  <p> Once you have the dependencies installed and the code built (if required), you can run the code using the instructions provided.
     Again, check the repository's documentation or README file for specific instructions on running the code. 
     This might involve executing a command in your terminal, running a script, or launching an application. 
    For example, if the repository provides a Python script named marching_cubes.py, you can run it using the following command:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
    # Example python marching_cubes.py
  </code></pre>
  <p>Make sure to provide any required input or arguments as mentioned in the repository's instructions.</p>

  <h2>Step 6: Explore the Results:</h2>
  <p>After running the code, you can explore the generated results or outputs. The specific outputs will depend on the functionality of the marching cubes algorithm implemented in the code. 
    You can refer to the repository's documentation or code comments for more details on how to interpret the results.</p>
